# The Safe Marketplace
This app allows two people to meet at a predetermined "Safe Location" to exchange goods or services.

## Using the Application
This is a React Native application with support for iOS, and Web. This was developed as a "Snack" on [Expo Dev](https://expo.dev/).
This application can be deployed and run from the Expo Go mobile application.

## Design decisions
For this demonstration, it is assumed that the user has already logged in. The map on the top of the screen displays "Safe Locations". Underneath, rests a list of
items for sale. Tapping on an item opens the purchase menu.

## What could be added in the future
The list of locations is currently stored in the application, this could be moved to a remote endpoint for easier updates. Login is currently the most pressing
feature!
